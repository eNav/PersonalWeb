				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
					<p1>
					Hi there! I'm a computer science major with a passion for technology and a love for problem-solving. Ever since I was a child, I've been fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology can bring, and as I've grown older, my curiosity has only intensified.

My journey in computer science started when I took a coding class in high school, and from then on, I knew I wanted to pursue this field. Throughout my studies, I've gained experience in a wide variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java, and C++. I've also been exposed to various areas of computer science, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering.

One of the things I love most about computer science is its endless potential for innovation. The fact that I can create something from scratch and watch it come to life is truly exciting. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge in the field.

Aside from coding, I enjoy playing video games and participating in hackathons, where I can collaborate with other like-minded individuals to develop new ideas and solutions. I believe that technology has the power to transform the world and I'm excited to be a part of that change.

As I continue on my journey in computer science, I'm eager to learn new skills and take on new projects. Whether it's building software or creating innovative new products, I'm always up for a challenge. If you have any questions or want to connect, feel free to reach out!
